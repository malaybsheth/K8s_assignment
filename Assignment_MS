Qeastion 1 >> Replica Set:: In replica set spcific no of pods running in the cluster at any time even if we delete the pod it will recreate. 
							In daemon set it will ensure that pod is presant in all the NODE. If you add the node it will create the POD. 
							Use Case : Log collection of each NODE



Qeastion 2>>  Deployment :: Need to update the image of deployment 
														kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v1	
														kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'
